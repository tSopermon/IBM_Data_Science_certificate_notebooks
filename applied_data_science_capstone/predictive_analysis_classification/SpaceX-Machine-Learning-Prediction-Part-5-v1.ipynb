    "Space X advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because Space X can reuse the first stage. Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against space X for a rocket launch.   In this lab, you will create a machine learning pipeline  to predict if the first stage will land given the data from the preceding labs.\n"

    "The active selection is a line of Python code that utilizes the `GridSearchCV` class from the `sklearn.model_selection` module. This class is used to perform hyperparameter tuning for a given estimator, in this case, a logistic regression model (`lr`). Hyperparameter tuning is the process of finding the optimal set of hyperparameters for a machine learning model to improve its performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this specific line, `GridSearchCV` is initialized with three arguments. The first argument, `lr`, represents the logistic regression estimator that you want to optimize. The second argument, `parameters`, is a dictionary containing the hyperparameters and their respective ranges or values that you want to test. The third argument, `cv=10`, specifies the number of cross-validation folds to use. Cross-validation is a technique for assessing how the results of a statistical analysis will generalize to an independent dataset. By setting `cv=10`, the data will be split into 10 subsets, and the model will be trained and validated 10 times, each time using a different subset as the validation set and the remaining subsets as the training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `GridSearchCV` process will evaluate all possible combinations of the provided hyperparameters and determine which combination yields the best performance based on the cross-validation results. This helps in selecting the most effective hyperparameters for the logistic regression model, ultimately leading to better predictive performance."
